I came up with this script when I discovered that KDE will not allow you to span a wallpaper across multiple monitors. This script will split an image in 3 sections vertically. Pipe source files into this script. Split files will be saved in the directory of the original source file.
Script relies on  Imagemagic and must be installed.
