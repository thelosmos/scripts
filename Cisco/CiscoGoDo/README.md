Two scripts that allow you to execute a command to a Cisco device. The inline version (go-do-inline) will expect you to provide the device IP followed by the command to be executed as arguments. It was written with intention of being able to pipe multiple targets to the script and execute the command against all of them. The go-do version will prompt for the device IP and command to be executed. Both were Written using Python3.7.
